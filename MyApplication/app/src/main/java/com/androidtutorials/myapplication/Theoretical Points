⃣rememberCoroutineScope
🔍 What it is

rememberCoroutineScope() provides a lifecycle-aware CoroutineScope that survives recomposition,
 But is cancelled when the composable leaves the composition.

It won t be executed during the First Time of the composition.

 🎯 When to Use rememberCoroutineScope
  Use it when you need to launch coroutines from user-driven actions, such as:


 ✔ Button clicks
 ✔ UI event handlers
 ✔ Manual coroutine launches
 ✔ API calls triggered from user interaction
 ✔ Animations that start on a click (not automatically on composition)


 ⚙️ Why We Use It

 Because LaunchedEffect cannot be triggered manually.

 👉 LaunchedEffect = automatic coroutine (runs when KEY changes)
 👉 rememberCoroutineScope = manual coroutine (runs when YOU trigger it)


 So use rememberCoroutineScope when:
 ✔ You need full control
 ✔ You don’t want coroutine to run automatically
 ✔ You don’t want to depend on state keys


 🛡️ Lifecycle Behavior

 🔸 Survives recomposition
  Does not restart on recomposition.
 🔸 Cancelled when composable leaves UI
  Safe for short-lived UI operations.
