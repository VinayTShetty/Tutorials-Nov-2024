1) To update the UI in any composble function.The composable function should be called again with the updated value.

2)We can use remember{mutablestateOf()} to update the value of the composable.

3)mutableStateOf is used to create an observable state of the object.
  When the value inside mutableStateOf changes, it triggers recomposition of any composables that read this state.

  i.e it acts as observable to keep track of the changes.

4) remember helps to make the composable to remember the old state.
        i.e if its incremented to 1 old state was 0.
        i.e if its incremented to 2 old state was 1.
        Its used because without knowing the previous state the composables will never get to know that they have a new value and its changed.
