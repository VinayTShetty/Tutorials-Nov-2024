ANDROID BROADCAST RECEIVER – NOTES & POINTS
========================================================

WHAT IS A BROADCAST RECEIVER?
----------------------------
A BroadcastReceiver is an Android component used to listen
and respond to broadcast messages sent by:
- Android system
- Other apps
- Your own app

It does NOT have a UI.

--------------------------------------------------------
WHY TO USE BROADCAST RECEIVER?
--------------------------------------------------------
- To listen for system-wide events
- To perform actions even when app is not running
- To communicate between app components
- To react instantly to changes (battery, network, etc.)

--------------------------------------------------------
WHEN TO USE BROADCAST RECEIVER?
--------------------------------------------------------
- Battery charging / discharging
- Network connectivity changes
- SMS received
- Device boot completed
- Airplane mode enabled/disabled
- Custom app events

--------------------------------------------------------
TYPES OF BROADCAST RECEIVERS
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Static (Manifest Registered)
   - Declared in AndroidManifest.xml
   - Works even when app is closed

2. Dynamic (Runtime Registered)
   - Registered in code
   - Active only while app/activity is running

--------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT METHODS
--------------------------------------------------------
onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent)

- Called when broadcast is received
- Runs on Main Thread
- Must execute quickly

--------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT RULES
--------------------------------------------------------
✔ No UI allowed

--------------------------------------------------------
REAL LIFE EXAMPLE
