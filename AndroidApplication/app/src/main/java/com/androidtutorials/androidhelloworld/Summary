How dependencies are wired:
**************************

MainActivity asks for Car.
Hilt sees Car needs Engine.
Hilt builds Engine, injects it into Car.
MainActivity gets a ready-to-use Car instance.



Field Injection Points
**********************
App Starts → MyApplication
    @HiltAndroidApp sets up Hilt globally.

MainActivity is Created
    Because of @AndroidEntryPoint, Hilt generates a special subclass of MainActivity that knows how to inject dependencies.

Field Injection Happens
    Before onCreate() is called, Hilt creates a Car object.
    While creating Car, Hilt sees that it has a method @Inject fun setEngine(...) →
    It first creates an Engine, then calls setEngine() automatically.

Ready-to-use Car is Assigned
    car field is initialized.

onCreate() Runs
    You use car.drive() safely since it is already injected with Engine


    Important Point :- In a method Injection.
    If a method is annotated with @Inject. Then Hilt will call this method automatically.
