WHY WE CANNOT CREATE A SERVICE OBJECT DIRECTLY (POINTS)

1. Services are Android framework components, not normal classes.
2. Android system is responsible for creating and destroying Services.
3. Creating a Service using a constructor bypasses Android lifecycle management.
4. Lifecycle methods like onCreate(), onBind(), onDestroy() will not be called.
5. The Service will not be registered with the Android system.
6. Android cannot manage memory and resources for that Service.
7. Security checks and permissions will not be enforced.
8. Inter-process communication (IPC) will not work.
9. Android cannot restart or stop the Service when required.
10. It violates Android component architecture rules.
11. Can cause memory leaks and unpredictable behavior.
12. Official Android documentation does not allow manual Service instantiation.


WHY WE SHOULD USE BINDER (POINTS)

1. Binder is the official communication mechanism provided by Android.
2. Android requires an IBinder object for binding to a Service.
3. Ensures proper lifecycle management of the Service.
4. Provides a controlled and safe way to access the Service.
5. Allows the Activity to communicate with the Service.
6. Works for both local and remote Services.
7. Enforces Android security and permission model.
8. Allows Android to track which clients are using the Service.
9. Supports multiple clients binding to the same Service.
10. Prevents unsafe direct object access.
11. Handles thread and process boundaries safely.
12. Mandatory because onBind() must return an IBinder.


WHY WE NEED ServiceConnection (POINTS)

1. Binding a Service is an asynchronous operation.
2. ServiceConnection tells when the Service is connected.
3. onServiceConnected() provides the IBinder safely.
4. Prevents calling Service methods before it is ready.
5. Handles unexpected Service disconnections.
6. onServiceDisconnected() is called if Service crashes.
7. Helps avoid NullPointerException.
8. Allows proper cleanup when Service is disconnected.
9. Required by the bindService() API.
10. Helps Android manage the Service–client relationship.
11. Supports multiple clients binding to the same Service.
12. Maintains connection lifecycle between Activity and Service.
